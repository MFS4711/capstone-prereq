# Purpose of Project

The Restaurant Web App is designed to streamline the management of reservations, menu items, and customer orders for a restaurant. It aims to enhance the dining experience for customers by providing an intuitive platform for booking tables and placing orders, while simplifying restaurant operations for staff and administrators. The app is built to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and foster better communication between customers, staff, and management, ultimately creating a smoother, more enjoyable restaurant experience.

The primary users of the Restaurant Web App are customers, staff, and restaurant administrators. Customers use the platform to easily manage their reservations, browse menu items, place orders, and track their order status. Staff members interact with the app to manage and update reservations, track orders, and ensure that menu items are available. Administrators and managers utilize the app to oversee operations, manage user accounts, and analyze restaurant performance. Each group is provided with tailored functionality based on their role to ensure smooth and efficient restaurant operations.

# Development Process

The development process for this project was carefully planned and documented to ensure efficient progress and transparency. This section outlines how the project was broken down into manageable tasks, tracked, and prioritized using GitHub Issues and Projects. It also covers the key steps taken, including project planning, SEO, data modeling, and data validation. Each sub-section provides a detailed look at the tools and methods used to guide development from initial planning to implementation.

## Project Planning and Documentation Using GitHub
GitHub Issues were used to document the development steps undertaken in the project. 
Two issue templates were created: one for [User Epics]() and another for [User Stories]().
A variety of labels were applied to categorise issue types, such as Bugs, User Epics, User Stories, and Style.
MoSCoW prioritisation was applied using the labels must-have, should-have, and could-have.
<!-- change labels listed as required -->

The project was broken down into manageable sprints using GitHub Projects, which provided a Kanban board. Issues were posted to the board and moved from "Todo" to "In Progress" to "Done" as they were completed.

The iterations are documented here :
    - [Iteration 1](link)
    - [Iteration 2](link)
    - ...

The User Epics and their related User Stories are as follows:
- Epic : [Epic Name](add_link_to_issue_in_github)
    - Story : [User Story title/description](add_link_to_issue_in_github)
    - Story : [User Story title/description](add_link_to_issue_in_github)
    - etc
- Epic : [Epic Name](add_link_to_issue_in_github)
    - Story : [User Story title/description](add_link_to_issue_in_github)
    - Story : [User Story title/description](add_link_to_issue_in_github)
    - etc
- etc.
<!-- repeat based on number of epics and stories - maybe display MoSCoW here - although will show in GitHub -->

<!-- Include this section and add depth if time at the end -->
## Search Engine Optimization
A set of long and short tail keywords was developed. 
The initial set was generated from a combination of brainstorming and examining the related searches returned by Google for these terms. This was then culled back to a smaller set of more targeted short- and long-tail keywords, which were each trialled on [wordtracker.com](https://wordtracker.com). 
This resulted in the following list of terms, ordered by volume:

|Term|Short/long-tail|Volume|Competition|
|---|---|---|---|
|'Word'|Short|226000|55.44|

After completing this research, I returned to the project's templates, and made the following changes:

- &lt;title> tag in base.html:
    - Set to '....'. This is one of the most important SEO locations ...
<!-- Add any tags in same form and bullet point impact of change -->

## Data Model
This section provides an overview of the data models used in the project, represented through Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) for each application. Each sub-heading corresponds to a specific app, detailing its database schema and the relationships between key entities. These ERDs were drawn using [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) and offer a clear visualization of how data is structured and flows within the application.

<!-- Add Apps and ERD Diagram for App -->

### ... App

![Entity-relationship diagram for ... App](docs/SOME_FILE_PATH)

### ... App

![Entity-relationship diagram for ... App](docs/SOME_FILE_PATH)

<!-- Repeat for each App -->

## Data Validation
<!-- List places where validators were used in model - i.e.price -->
<!-- If someone tries a negative number, error will occur and some action will happen - describe  -->
The following decimal fields, representing currency amounts, are protected by Django's MinValueValidator, with the minimum value being set at 0.

<!-- Also add any JS checks on form fields etc. to ensure desired action/errors are caught -->

# Testing

The Testing section covers various strategies used to ensure the application's functionality and quality. This includes **manual testing** for hands-on verification, **validator testing** to check data integrity, **user story testing** to confirm features meet user requirements, and **automated testing** to streamline repeated tests and ensure consistent performance throughout development. Each approach contributes to a robust, error-free application.

## Manual Testing

### Feature Testing
The manual testing of features is organised by app below. Testing was carried out on a 1920 x 1080 desktop screen, a Samsung tablet and an Samsung S22 Ultra.
<!-- Amend devices as required for testing -->

<summary>... App</summary>
<!-- Example of how to layout table below -->
|Page|Feature|Action|Effect|
|---|---|---|---|
|/basket/view_basket/|All items appear in list|Add item to list in product_detail page|Item appears on table|
|/basket/view_basket/|Item quantities are correct|Add n items in product_detail page|n items appear on table|
</details>

<!-- Repeat for each app - make sure all buttons/forms/elements in general are tested - be thorough -->
<details>
<summary>... App</summary>
<!-- Example of how to layout table below -->

## User Story Testing
The User Epics and Stories for this project are documented across ... GitHub Projects, each corresponding to a specific iteration of the development work. You can find them here:

- [Iteration 1](link)
- [Iteration 2](link)
- etc .

Alternitively, the Epics and Stories are individually linked here :

- [Epics and Stories](#development-process)

In both cases, the status of each issue will indicate whether the user story has been completed.

## Automated Testing

### Testing django views, models and forms
A full suite of automated tests is included in the project. The tests for each app are located in the `test/` folder within each respective app and can be run using the following command :

`python3 manage.py test`

The most recent coverage report is available in the `htmlcov/` folder at the project's root. To view it, you can serve the report locally by running Python's built-in HTTP server from the root folder :

`python3 -m http.server`

To generate the coverage HTML report, use the following commands:

`coverage run manage.py test`

`coverage html`

# Deployment

This section provides a step-by-step guide for deploying your project to Heroku, ensuring that all necessary configurations and settings are in place for both development and production environments. Before deploying, you'll first clone the repository to your local machine to ensure that the original repo remains untouched during development. Follow these instructions to set up the app locally, deploy it to Heroku, and configure essential services like the database, social logins, and payment processing. By the end of this process, your app will be live and accessible on the web.

## Making a Local Clone
1. Open a terminal/command prompt on your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository :

    `git clone 'REPO_LINK'`

<!-- May need to refactor section as maybe arrange it to first confirm  -->
## Running in Local Environment
<!-- Add steps taken - packages installed to ensure local environment works -->
<!-- Maybe remove common steps from heroku section -->

## Deploying to Heroku
1. **Log into Heroku** and navigate to the Dashboard.
2. Click the **'New'** button.
3. Choose a **unique app name** and select the region relevant to you.
4. **Create a Database** - As a student at Code Institute, I used [CI Database Maker](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/) but this can also be achieved on Heroku by paying a monthly fee and following the below steps:
<!-- Add steps to create database here - i.e. Procfile and relevant code etc -->

5. Go to the **Settings** tab, and click **Reveal Config Vars**. Add the following config variables, if not already present:
    - **Django secret key**
    - **Database URL**
    - **Cloudinary API**
    - etc
    <!-- List all config vars visible - not giving their values -->
6. In your **local repository**, add a **Procfile** to the root directory with this content:

    `web: gunicorn strings-attached.wsgi`

7. Add your Heroku app URL to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list in `settings.py`.
8. Create ... social apps for Facebook and Google login:
    - Add their API keys and Secrets to the database.
    - Configure your application details and callback URLs in the Google and Facebook OAuth dashboards.
    <!-- Amend this step based on if socials are used or not -->

9. Set `DEBUG` to `False` in `settings.py`, then commit and push your changes to GitHub.
10. Navigate to the **Deploy** tab in the Dashboard. Under **Deployment Method**, click the **GitHub** icon to connect your Heroku app to your GitHub repository.
    - Enter your repository name, click **Search**, then click **Connect**.
11. Under the **Manual Deploy** section, click **Deploy Branch**. Once deployed, you should see the message **"Your app was successfully deployed"**.
12. Click **Open App** to open the app in the browser.
